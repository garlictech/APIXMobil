Version: 0.12.0

Usage:

- For login, use the credentials of the test database (db). In the test db, there is only one user ("Avis"), with no password defined. So, the password field is ignored for the moment, only Avis will be authenticated when using
database. Password field should not be empty, anyway.
- In Advanced Settings, you can set the server address. The current default is apixserver.selfip.com. When this is set, the app will contact the server in cases where the server side query is implemented. In unimeplemented cases, the app returns mock data, build in the app (no server contact).

Changes:

- Bug fix: activity indicator is not displayed when updating tabled from cached
data.
- Temporary “Spanish translation”: English text with “-s” suffix. It prevents from errors related to missing translation strings.
- Bugfix: when changing language, and there is much data cached, it takes long
time. Solution: ui updated only when a window gets focus.
- If there is no image (no data), the screen does not become black in case of device rotation.
- When clicking on a table row, ther is a visual blink to indicate that click has happened.
- Support Spanish language.

- App communicates with server. You must set proper server name/ip and give
authentication login. In the current database, there is only one user with no
password set, so this version does not check password, temporarily. With the test database, the only working username is "Avis".
- Server returns test data, except for querying Cards table. It is a real query.
- Server ignores date settings, and ignores other permissions, only demonstrates a successfull database - server - app path.

Fixed problems:

- When a table row has a child, and we refresh, the first table row shifts to right.
- When there is no "ontime" set, and we set it, the already open windows do not show it in red, when we go back. When we reopen the windows (click on table rows), it is OK.
- In case of logout or factory reset, the open tables should close.
